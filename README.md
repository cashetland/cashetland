- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cashetland
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in open source software, 3D graphics -- particularly Blender -- and high-performance computing -- particularly accelerator/GPU.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply transformer models to 3D graphics tasks, e.g. modeling 3D meshes, rigging, organizing large 3D scenes.
